If you have a lot of existing Spring applications it may be useful to share libraries between Micronaut and Spring.

This is a common requirement if you want to say share common injectable components that can be added to classpath.

If you have this use case you can add resolve it by using Spring annotations to define the components using annotations like link:{springapi}org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html[@Configuration], link:{springapi}org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html[@Component] and link:{springapi}org/springframework/context/annotation/Bean.html[@Bean].

For example:

.Example Spring Configuration
[source, java]
----
include::spring-context/src/test/java/io/micronaut/spring/annotation/context/MyConfiguration.java[tags=class, indent=0]
----

The above configuration can that exposes a bean of type `MyBean` can be imported and used by any Spring application using the link:{springapi}org/springframework/context/annotation/Import.html[@Import] annotation declared as follows:

.Using `@Import`
[source, java]
----
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import;

@Import(MyConfiguration.class)
class Application {}
----

You can additionally use the same configuration in a Micronaut application by use the same declaration as above assuming you have correctly configured Micronaut for Spring. See the example project that is part of the guide https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-spring-boot.html[Run a Spring Boot Application as a Micronaut Application] for how to configure Micronaut for Spring.

Micronaut will import all declared beans at compilation time. The only limitation is that `ImportBeanDefinitionRegistrar` that require runtime interfaces like `BeanClassLoaderAware` will fail to import with a compilation error since import processing happens during compilation with Micronaut. When creating shared components try avoid defining `ImportBeanDefinitionRegistrar` types that depend on one of the following interfaces:

* `BeanClassLoaderAware`
* `BeanFactoryAware`
* `EnvironmentAware`
* `ResourceLoaderAware`
