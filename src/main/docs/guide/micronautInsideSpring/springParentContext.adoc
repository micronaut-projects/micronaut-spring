You can also use Micronaut for Spring as the parent application context to a regular Spring application.

This has a number of benefits, you can for example define beans using Micronaut and consume any Micronaut beans into a Spring application, resulting in Spring using less memory and having reflection free infrastructure.

You can also use any Micronaut feature from a regular Spring Boot or Spring application including the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#clientAnnotation[declaring clients for HTTP] and https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#kafkaClient[Kafka].

You can also use any compilation time tools from Micronaut with Spring such as Micronaut's support for https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#openapi[Swagger].

The following example shows how to Configure your Spring Boot application with a Micronaut powered parent application context using `SpringApplicationBuilder`:

.Using the Micronaut Parent Context
[source,java]
----
SpringApplicationBuilder builder = new SpringApplicationBuilder();
MicronautApplicationContext context = new MicronautApplicationContext();
context.start();
builder.parent(context);
builder.sources(Application);
builder.build().run();
