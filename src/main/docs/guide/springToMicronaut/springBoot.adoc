For additional support for Spring Boot you should add the following dependencies:

.Including `spring-boot` processing
[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
dependencies {

    ...
    // additional Spring Boot dependencies
    annotationProcessor "io.micronaut.spring:micronaut-spring-boot-annotation:{version}"
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")

    // additional Spring Boot dependencies for Micronaut
    runtime("io.micronaut.spring:micronaut-spring-boot:{version}")
}
----

With the above dependencies in place the following Spring Boot specific annotations are supported:

With support for `@Configuration` and the majority of Spring Boot conditions it is possible to build auto configurations that work with both Spring Boot and Micronaut.

In addition the following Spring Boot Actuator annotations are supported:


.Supported Spring Boot Actuator Annotations

|Spring Actuator Boot Annotation|Target Annotation|Notes

|link:{springbootapi}/org/springframework/boot/actuate/endpoint/annotation/Endpoint.html[@Endpoint]
|link:{micronautapi}management/endpoint/annotation/Endpoint.html[@Endpoint]
| Example `@Endpoint("features")`


|link:{springbootapi}/org/springframework/boot/actuate/endpoint/annotation/ReadOperation.html[@ReadOperation]
|link:{micronautapi}management/endpoint/annotation/Read.html[@Read]
| Example `@ReadOperation`

What this enables is the ability to write management endpoints that work with both Spring Boot and Micronaut.
